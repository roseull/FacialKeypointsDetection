# Facial Keypoints Detection
Find the key points on the human face
### --- Objective ---<br />
The objective of this task is using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to predict keypoint positions on face images.

### --- Data description ---<br />
The data is from Kaggle, which contains a set of face images. The input image consists of a list of 96x96 pixels.

Each predicted keypoint is specified by an (x,y) real-valued pair in the space of pixel indices. 15 keypoints in the dataset represent the different elements of the face (left_eye_center, right_eye_center, nose_tip â€¦);

The input image is given in the last field of the data files, consists of a list of pixels, as integers in (0,255). The images are 96x96 pixels;

The training data contains a list of 7049 images. Each row contains the (x,y) coordinates for 15 keypoints, and image data as row-ordered list of pixels:<br />  

Test data contains a list of 1783 test images. Each row contains ImageId and image data as row-ordered list of pixels:<br />  

### --- CNN Model ---<br />
The formula for calculating the output size(height or length) for any given convolutional layer is<br />

where O is the output height/length, W is the input height/length, K is the filter size, P is the padding, and S is the stride.<br /><br />

### --- Optimizer ---<br />
Adam is a method for efficient stochastic optimization that only requires first-order gradients with little memory requirement. Adam Optimizer is used in this project.

### --- Evaluation ---<br />
Submissions are scored by Kaggle on the Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE):<br />

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=RMSE=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i-\hat{y}_i)}^2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?RMSE=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i-\hat{y}_i)}^2}" title="RMSE=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i-\hat{y}_i)}^2}" /></a>

### --- Result visualization ---<br />
Find 15 keypoints in the dataset represent the different elements of the face. Left and right here refers to the point of view of the subject.
